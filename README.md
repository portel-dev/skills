## 🌟 Why JavaScript/TypeScript Implementation?

### vs Python Implementation (Anthropic)

| Feature | Python-based | JavaScript-based (NCP) |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Execution | Requires Python | Native JavaScript |
| Installation | pip + system deps | npm only |
| Performance | Interpreter overhead | Native V8 |
| Compatibility | Platform-specific | Cross-platform |
| Integration | External process | Direct execution |
| Dependencies | Complex | Simple |

### Benefits

- ✅ **Zero setup** - Works immediately in Node.js environments
- ✅ **Fast** - Native V8 performance
- ✅ **Portable** - Single ecosystem (npm)
- ✅ **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support
- ✅ **Modern** - ES6+, async/await, promises
- ✅ **Compatible** - Works with Anthropic's skill format

## 🛠️ Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/portel-dev/skills.git
cd skills

# Skills are pure markdown - no dependencies needed
# Each skill is self-contained in its SKILL.md file
```
